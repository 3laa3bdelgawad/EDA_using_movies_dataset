## Conculution 

Based on my exploratory data analysis of the movie dataset using Python, I can conclude that there are several interesting insights that can be gained from the data.

Firstly, I can see that there are missing values in some of the columns of the dataset, but these missing values are not significant enough to affect my analysis.

I also discovered that there are some outliers in the data, particularly in the gross column, which suggests that there are some movies that have performed exceptionally well compared to others.

Furthermore, I found that there is a strong positive correlation between the budget and gross earnings of movies, indicating that higher budget movies tend to perform better at the box office. There is also a positive correlation between the movie score and gross earnings, which suggests that higher-rated movies tend to perform better commercially.

Finally, I identified the top 15 companies that have earned the most gross revenue, as well as the top movies based on various factors such as popularity, revenue, and ratings.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the movie industry, which can be useful for decision-making and future planning.
